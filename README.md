# esx_t_offduty
Simple on/off -duty script made with LUA and JSON.

Instead of having to add jobs like 'offambulance' or 'offpolice', this script sets you as unemployed and saves your job and grade in the .json file.
When you take your job back the .json file deletes your data, basically just cleans itself.
